# Galaxy Band Conversion- For Mapping Galaxy Images Through Ultraviolet, Infrared and Visible Light Observation

As it currently stands, the available model and training data comes from the Illustris cosmological simulations. To train a model from scratch, run the 'main.py' script in the 'python_scripts' file. Note that validation statistics will be run at the end of training on the final model.

Please specify the suffix in 'main.py', otherwise it will remain as 'replace_ME'.

Before running any of the above, you must download the desired training data. To do that, please run the shell scripts corresponding to the desired bands in the 'illustris_shell_scripts' file.

Training logs and saved models are available as well.
